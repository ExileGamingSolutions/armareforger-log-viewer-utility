These files take a raw text log from an Arma Reforger game server and parses and catorgorizes
it into groups based off the header topics(RENDER, NETWORK, ENGINE, etc).
In its current state you will be required to write a small script to read the output
of the parse.



This is the start of bigger project, I intend on making mulitple version of this.
One for server-side automation, and another GUI based program for desktop analysis
